## Description

This repository contains an Excel file that demonstrates the application of basic formatting tools and data analysis techniques to employee data from Company X. The data analysis focuses on 20 randomly selected employees.

The report consists of three worksheets:
1. Sheet 1
2. Sheet 2
3. Sheet 3

## Sheet 1: Salary Analysis

On the first sheet, specific formatting tools, particularly conditional formatting, have been used to analyze the salaries of the employees. This includes the identification of employees earning over $10,000, with their corresponding cells highlighted using "cell value" conditional formatting. Additionally, freelancers have been filtered out of the dataset to provide a clear representation of salaried employees.

## Sheet 2: Name Separation and Duplicate Identification

The second sheet focuses on the separation of employee full names into first and last names using various built-in Excel functions such as LEFT, RIGHT, LENGTH, and FIND. As a part of the analysis, the identification of employees with common last names has been highlighted as duplicates, aiding in the visualization of potential data anomalies. Conditional formatting has been applied specifically to column D (last name), and any duplicates are displayed in yellow.

## Sheet 3: Salary Range and Employee Name Analysis

The third sheet of the workbook is dedicated to analyzing employee names based on specific criteria. Here, employee full names starting with the letter "E" have been highlighted using the "Cell value begins with..." conditional formatting feature. Moreover, the conditional formatting rules have been set to visually emphasize the maximum (highest) and minimum (lowest) salaries in the salary array. The maximum salary is highlighted in green, while the minimum salary is highlighted in red, allowing for easy identification and comparison.
